Hot keys for media players such as VLC Player / AIMP
Set VLC Player to listen for global keys

## VLC Setup 
I personally use VLC only for video
VLC -> Tools -> Preferences -> HotKeys
search for "Play/Pause" and set it in Global column to CTRL+SHIFT+x
search for "Very short backwards jump" and set it in Global column to CTRL+SHIFT+v
search for "Very short forward jump" and set it in Global column to CTRL+SHIFT+b

## AIMP Setup
I personally use VLC only for audio/mp3/radio
AIMP -> CTRL + P -> Hotkeys (left menu)
Search for "Play/Pause" and set it in Global 1 column to SHIFT+CTRL+X
Search for "Previous track" and set it in Global 1 column to SHIFT+CTRL+V
Search for "Next track" and set it in Global 1 column to SHIFT+CTRL+B



### DO NOT RUN VLC and AIMP SIMULTANEOUSLY


## Any Other Player Setup 
Almost every popular media player has a hotkeys
Usually you can add/change hotkeys.
Set hot keys as global keys, that it can control your player from any window 
(even if player not in focus, on other screen, or minimized)
Set play/pause functionality to global key CTRL+SHIFT+x
Set prev functionality to global key CTRL+SHIFT+v
Set next functionality to global key CTRL+SHIFT+b
