Hot keys for media players such as VLC Player / AIMP
Set VLC Player to listen for global keys

## VLC Setup 
I personally use VLC only for video <br />
VLC -> Tools -> Preferences -> HotKeys <br />
search for "Play/Pause" and set it in Global column to CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+F5 <br />
search for "Very short backwards jump" and set it in Global column to CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+F4 <br />
search for "Very short forward jump" and set it in Global column to CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+F6 <br />
<br />
## AIMP Setup 
I personally use VLC only for audio/mp3/radio <br />
AIMP -> CTRL + P -> Hotkeys (left menu) <br />
Search for "Play/Pause" and set it in Global 1 column to CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+F2 <br />
Search for "Previous track" and set it in Global 1 column to CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+F1 <br />
Search for "Next track" and set it in Global 1 column to CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+F3 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
### DO NOT RUN VLC and AIMP SIMULTANEOUSLY
<br />
 
## Any Other Player Setup 
Almost every popular media player has a hotkeys <br />
Usually you can add/change hotkeys. <br />
Set hot keys as global keys, that it can control your player from any window <br /> 
(even if player not in focus, on other screen, or minimized) <br />
Set play/pause functionality to global key CTRL+SHIFT+x <br />
Set prev functionality to global key CTRL+SHIFT+v <br />
Set next functionality to global key CTRL+SHIFT+b <br />
<br />
<br />

## Windows autorun on startup
